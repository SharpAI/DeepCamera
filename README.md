# What's SharpAI DeepCamera
This is a unique repository in many ways. It’s a deep learning model open sourced to protect your privacy. The entire DeepCamera concept is based on automated machine learning (AutoML). So you don’t even need any programming experience to train a new model.

DeepCamera works on Android devices.
You can integrate the code with surveillance cameras as well. There’s a LOT you can do with DeepCamera’s code, including:

- Face recognition
- Face Detection
- Control from mobile application
- Object detection
- Motion detection
- Human ReID (Recognition based on human shape)

And a whole host of other things. Building your own AI-powered model has never been this easy!

## How to develop on SharpAI DeepCamera

You can develop on SharpAI DeepCamera almost on every devices.

### [How to Run DeepCamera on 64-bit Android From Source Code](docs/Run_Source_Android_aarch64.md)
### [How to Run DeepCamera on 32-bit Android](docs/RunOnRK3288.md)
### [Run on Raspberry Pi](docs/RunOnRaspberryPi.md)
### Run on Embedded Linux with docker (Rockchip RK3399)
```
git clone https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera
cd DeepCamera/docker  
sudo ./run-deepeye-prebuilt.sh start
```
### Run on X86 Laptop Docker
```
git clone https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera -b pc_version
cd DeepCamera/docker
sudo ./run-deepeye-x86.sh start #make sure Serial No is in docker/workaipython/ro_serialno
```   

## It is even possible to integrate with your Surveilance Camera 

### Through Shinobi (if you install DeepCamera through Docker)
Then you need to follow [Shinobi's document](https://shinobi.video) to add camera. or [click to see our tutorial](https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera/blob/master/docs/shinobi.md)

password: SharpAI2018 

You can also [turn Mac Camera into RTSP camera(not tested)](https://www.tribler.org/MacWebcam/)

### Through Dahua SDK (if you install DeepCamera on Android)
Code is [here](https://github.com/SharpAI/RTSP_Decoder_IJKPlayer/blob/od_gl_based/android/ijkplayer/ijkplayer-example/src/main/java/tv/danmaku/ijk/media/example/activities/CameraScanActivity.java#L147)


## Survey: Do you want to have Dev Kit for easily startup
We are considering to provide full set of development kit to easy the setup effort you may face to.
