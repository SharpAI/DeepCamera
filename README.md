# What's SharpAI DeepCamera
Deep Learning video processing surveillance on ARM GPU for face recognition and much more on the way. Turn digital camera into AI-powered camera. Production level platform for edge AI using ARM GPU/NPU, leveraging AutoML. The first world-class Edge AI full stack platform for developer/kids/home/SMB/enterprise/cloud, baking by community.

Full stack system for the deep learning edge computing devices, espeicailly set-up-box off the shell with image burning or Android apk installation.

## Data labeling on Mobile, no data scientist involed
## Automatically train/deploy model for edge device(Embedded/Android/X86 system)
## Power efficient, Easy scalable, Production ready

# Purchase Dev Kit for easily startup
Run from code is time consuming task even with experts' supporting, we are considering to provide full set of development kit to easy the setup effort you may face to. 
[Please thumb up if you want one](https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera/issues/8)
### How it works from end user's point of view, green parts are done if using Dev Kit

# How to Run DeepCamera From Source Code

## 1. Generate/Get Serial No
### Android
After install Launcher(Modified Termux), the serial_no will be placed:
`/data/data/com.termux/files/home/.ro_serialno`
### Linux/MacOS
Get your Mac Address(1e:20:34:10:24:21)
```
cd DeepCamera
echo 1e2034102421 > docker/workaipython/ro_serialno
```
## 2. Then generate text type QR code with serial_no you just got
[QR code Generator](https://cli.im/)

## 3. How to Run DeepCamera on Edge Device

### 3.1 Run on Rockchip RK3399 with linux/docker
#### 3.1.1 Use prebuilt docker images
```
git clone https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera
cd DeepCamera/docker  
sudo ./run-deepeye-prebuilt.sh start
```
### 3.2 [Run on Rockchip RK3288 with Android 5.1](docs/RunOnRK3288.md)
### 3.3 Run on X86 Laptop Docker
#### 3.3.1 Use prebuilt docker images
```
git clone https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera -b pc_version
cd DeepCamera/docker
sudo ./run-deepeye-x86.sh start #make sure Serial No is in docker/workaipython/ro_serialno
```   
#### 3.3.2 Build docker images on your local machine
```
git clone https://github.com/SharpAI/ImageBuilder-DeepLearning -b android_porting
cd ImageBuilder-DeepLearning/Docker-DeepEye/workai/
./build_x86_dockers.sh
```
Then run DeepCamera, will use local docker images

```
git clone https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera
cd DeepCamera/docker
docker-compose -f docker-compose-x86.yml up
```

### 3.4 Run on RockPro64 Android 7.1
coming soon

### 3.5 Run on Raspberry Pi
coming soon

## 4. Link to Your Camera
Then you need to follow [Shinobi's document](https://shinobi.video) to add camera. or [click to see our tutorial](https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera/blob/master/docs/shinobi.md)

# Call For Help
- [ ] Documents, A LOT OF DOCUMENTS, we already deploy our deep camera in industry leading company but we don't have extra resource to build up community friendly documents.
- [ ] Tutorial on youtube, we can build up some of them, only if with your help, we can success together.
- [ ] Translation, we did deploy our production in China, much of our resource is in Chinese, need your help to translate, especially the Mobile APP built with Meteor https://github.com/SharpAI/mobile_app_server  (need i18n selection based on system language)
- [ ] Remove unused code/project in https://github.com/SharpAI/mobile_app_server
- [ ] PR, more than welcome, anything :)
- [ ] Meetup hosts, in Silicon Valley
