## [On Raspberry Pi 3B+/4B](docs/RUN_ON_PI_V2.md)

## Connect Streaming
### Through Open Source NVR

Shinobi login page(device_ip:8080):   
username: user@sharpaibox.com  
password: SharpAI2018 

Change IP configuration and camera url on the page. [Detail information](https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera/blob/master/docs/shinobi.md)   
If you are using other camera support streaming, please check [The Shinobi NVR's document](https://shinobi.video)  [Supported Devices](docs/Supported_Devices.md)

## Connect DeepCamera to API Server

### Get device serial number
```
cat docker/workaipython/ro_serialno 
82f28703d001
```
`82f28703d001` is device ID
### Create User on API Server
REST API:
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/api/v1/sign-up -d '{"username": "test11", "email": "xxxx@xxx.xx", "password": "xxxxxx"}'
```
Response:
```
{
  "success": true
}
```
### Get Token of created user
REST API:
```
curl -X POST -H "Content-type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/api/v1/login/ -d '{"username": "test11", "email": "xxxx@xxx.xx", "password": "123456"}'
```
Response:
```
{
  "status": "success",
  "data": {
    "authToken": "t6QsPaU3VdbfUQMkNIf6I3MDtox29WLrPJRAKkOCfpc",
    "userId": "tiK8RYG87sGJAErdB"
  }
}
```
### Create Group on API Server
Rest API:

Fill in `X-Auth-Token` and `X-User-Id` in previous response.
```
curl -X POST -H "X-Auth-Token: t6QsPaU3VdbfUQMkNIf6I3MDtox29WLrPJRAKkOCfpc" -H "X-User-Id: tiK8RYG87sGJAErdB" http://localhost:3000/api/v1/groups -d "name=group01"
```
Response:
```
{
  "groupId": "e309ff8c7a3a8ceb4011e86e"
}
```
### Add device to Group on API Server
REST API:
Replace `X-Auth-Token` and `X-User-Id`.
Replace group id in requesting URL: http://localhost:3000/api/v1/groups/`e309ff8c7a3a8ceb4011e86e`/devices
```
curl -X POST -H "X-Auth-Token: t6QsPaU3VdbfUQMkNIf6I3MDtox29WLrPJRAKkOCfpc" -H "X-User-Id: tiK8RYG87sGJAErdB" -H "Content-type: application/json" http://localhost:3000/api/v1/groups/e309ff8c7a3a8ceb4011e86e/devices -d '{"uuid": "82f28703d001", "deviceName": "testDevice", "name":"testdevice","type": "inout"}'
```
Response:
```
{
  "success": true
}
```

Then restart DeepCamera service.

## Rebuild Mobile App to connect to your own API Server(Doc WIP)
### Clone https://github.com/SharpAI/ApiServer
### Setup your own travis service for CI (to build your own APK on travis)
### Setup your own sign keystore, setup your own Environment
### Trigger build

## [Labelling and receive message sent from DeepCamera with Face Detection/Recognition result](https://github.com/SharpAI/SharpAIMobileApp#how-to-use-sharpai-app)

### API Server document can be found here: [SharpAI/ApiServer](https://github.com/SharpAI/ApiServer#full-api-document)
