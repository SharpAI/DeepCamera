# [Quick Installation on Android](https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera/releases/tag/v1.2.1)

To speed up the evaluation of DeepCamera platform, SharpAI Dev Team developed an Application to use Android Camera instead of surveillance camera, remove hardware dependency will speed up the evaluation procedure for developers.

There would be some issues caused by Camera quality on the device, it always has better result if replace Android camera to surveillance camera but still, our Android AI camera is state-of-the-art production leveraging AutoML for Edge devices.

# What's SharpAI DeepCamera
Deep Learning video processing surveillance on ARM GPU for face recognition and much more on the way. Turn digital camera into AI-powered camera. Production level platform for edge AI using ARM GPU/NPU, leveraging AutoML. The first world-class Edge AI full stack platform for developer/kids/home/SMB/enterprise/cloud, baking by community.

Full stack system for the deep learning edge computing devices, espeicailly set-up-box off the shell with image burning or Android apk installation.

## Data labeling on Mobile, no data scientist involed
## Automatically train/deploy model for edge device(Embedded/Android/X86 system)
## Power efficient, Easy scalable, Production ready, Mobile first

## How to develop on SharpAI DeepCamera

You can develop on SharpAI DeepCamera almost on every devices.

### [How to Run DeepCamera on 64-bit Android From Source Code](docs/Run_Source_Android_aarch64.md)
### [How to Run DeepCamera on 32-bit Android](docs/RunOnRK3288.md)
### [Run on Raspberry Pi](docs/RunOnRaspberryPi.md)
### Run on Embedded Linux with docker (Rockchip RK3399)
```
git clone https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera
cd DeepCamera/docker  
sudo ./run-deepeye-prebuilt.sh start
```
### Run on X86 Laptop Docker
```
git clone https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera -b pc_version
cd DeepCamera/docker
sudo ./run-deepeye-x86.sh start #make sure Serial No is in docker/workaipython/ro_serialno
```   

## It is even possible to connect Surveilance Camera 

### Through Shinobi (if you install DeepCamera through Docker)
Then you need to follow [Shinobi's document](https://shinobi.video) to add camera. or [click to see our tutorial](https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera/blob/master/docs/shinobi.md)

Shinobi login page(device_ip:8080):   
username: user@sharpaibox.com  
password: SharpAI2018 

You can also [turn Mac Camera into RTSP camera(not tested)](https://www.tribler.org/MacWebcam/)

### Through Dahua SDK (if you install DeepCamera on Android)
Code is [here](https://github.com/SharpAI/RTSP_Decoder_IJKPlayer/blob/od_gl_based/android/ijkplayer/ijkplayer-example/src/main/java/tv/danmaku/ijk/media/example/activities/CameraScanActivity.java#L147)


## Survey: Do you want to have Dev Kit for easily startup
We are considering to provide full set of development kit to easy the setup effort you may face to. 
[Please thumb up if you want one](https://github.com/SharpAI/DeepCamera/issues/8)

### How it works from end user's point of view, green parts are done if using Dev Kit
