## Local deployment is ready for testing now

Since the most concern from community is security/privacy, we implemented local deployment by sharpai-cli command line.
```
sharpai-cli local_deepcamera start
```
It will bring up everything on you own machine, so after the setup, you can disconnect your machine from internet and it will still work.
This release is supporting x86 machine.
When you have everything running, the GUI will be here: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
